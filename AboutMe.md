I love playing cricket alot. I represented as a captian for my school team which won prestagious tournament cup at that moment. Still, I tried hard to continue my practice but eventually lost touch of it due to hectic schedule which I have daily. I still love to play cricket with friends in my free time but don't know I could get that.
